of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions:

scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The
functioning of the Halo platform and HALO could be impacted by one or

of Alternative, Unofficial Halo platform: Following the Coin Issuance

of Insufficient Interest in the Halo platform or Distributed

of an Illiquid Market for HALO: The Company is not aware of any a

HALO. There are currently no exchanges upon which HALO would trade.

subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may therefore
be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated
